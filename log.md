# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for a freeCodeCamp account and went through the Basic HTML and HTML5 tutorial.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
